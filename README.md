## Welcome to Flaskr!

Flaskr is a codealong tutorial maintained by the developer's of Flask, a Python library for building simple web applications. After building my first simple flask application, it became abundantly clear to me that I needed a more in-depth understanding of the library and its capabilities in order to build the more complex project I'm working on under contract, and I'm pushing my work to my own repo to give it some visibility!
